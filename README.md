# Taxi-Fare-ML-Project

This project uses a dataset given to me by my mentor Alan Cha for me to practice understanding and implementing Machine Learning algorithms.

After conducting some thorough data processing and some basic cleaning, I used both a DecisionTreeRegressor and a RandomForestRegressor. 

These ML models used a variety of input factors, such as the duration and distance traveled of a taxi ride, to estimate the fare of the taxi.
